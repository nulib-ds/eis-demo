# Loring Park, Minnesota

The Loring Park Development will provide a **major new residential complex** within very convenient access to the full range of urban services and ameneties. It also will create a major new hotel/convention center, and will provide coherence of design to the nine-block project area. The major environmental costs of the development will be the **substantial demolition of existing business and residential structures,** with the attendant **displacement of the indigenous population;** the vacation of streets for the greenway construction, which will result in increased traffic congestion and air/noise pollution problems; creation of short-term noise, dust and disruption of pedestrian and vehicular traffic associated with construction activities; erection of tall and massive structures which create the potential for adverse shadow and wind effects; and concentration of the population with attendant increases in demand for local and urban facilities and services.

# Involved Agencies

### Part I. 
"Since the proposed project has already entailed substantial demolition of indigenous structures (about 46 buildings, or approximately 70% of the entire demolition workload, has already been completed), a description of the neighborhood that is giving way to this development will be described in some detail,"
